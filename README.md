# Sign-Language-Detector
A real-time sign language detection system using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text.

Features:
Detects and classifies sign language gestures in real-time.
Uses a trained deep learning model for accurate recognition.
Implements OpenCV for image processing and hand tracking.
Displays the recognized gesture as text on the screen.

Installation:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install Requirements
4. Run collect_imgs.py
5. Run create_dataset.py
6. Run train_classifier.py
7. Run inference_classifier.py

Usage
Ensure your webcam is connected.
Run the script, and the system will start detecting sign language gestures.
The recognized gestures will be displayed as text in real-time.

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model)
